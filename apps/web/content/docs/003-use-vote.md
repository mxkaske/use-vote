## useVote()

> It is a headless way to include a Component. Check out the [/examples](/examples/thumbs) for concrete implementations.

We do not provide any predefined UI within the package. Instead, use `useVote` to access the properties and trigger a button event according to the users vote.

```tsx
import { useVote } from "@evalu8/next";
```

// TODO: check developer docs for inspiration. Check how they deal with function properties
